# Elijah James And The Nightmares Website

## A fully responsive website with custom modals, sliding nav bars, and smooth scrolling.

Keeping the website's colour theme based around the album art, I began by designing the hero section to show off sample artwork from the album. This immediately creates a mood for the website, and provides a visually pleasing experience.

To maintain the mood for the website, as well as increase immersion and provide a fluid experience when using the site, I decided to make it entirely one page (except for external links to web-stores and streaming platforms), utilising smooth scrolling. This keeps all the vital information about the band in one place, making it easy to find - especially useful when a website's main focus is to provide key information to a user.

To keep a serious (opposed to playful), artistic aesthetic which suited the bands mood, I also ensured everything - such as buttons and images - had sharp corners (no border-radius).

I used JavaScript to implement various functional aspects of the site, such as automatically updating the copyright date in the footer, sticky navigation, opening all the modals with the correct information for the clicked album or video, and ensuring the YouTube video's pause when a user exits the video modal.

With zero prior knowledge, and having only been coding for 11 weeks, I feel this was a huge lesson in the basics of HTML and CSS, as well as advanced DOM manipulation.

I also made an effort to refactor my JavaScript to keep it DRY and readable.
